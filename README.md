# Sailboat Exhibit

## Overview

The Sailboat Exhibit is an immersive Unity project designed to simulate realistic sailing physics, ocean interactions, and dynamic weather and sky conditions. The primary objective of this exhibit is to educate visitors on celestial navigation by challenging them to escape a storm using the stars as their guide. The sailboat is controlled via a physical rudder attached to a life-sized model, providing an engaging and hands-on experience.
